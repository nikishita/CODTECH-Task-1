## Overview of the Project

### Project: Customer Segmentation and Analysis using K-Means Clustering

**Description:**  
This project leverages the power of K-Means clustering to segment customers based on key attributes such as age, annual income, and spending score. By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of each group, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and boosting sales.

**Objective:**  
The primary objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to discover patterns and groupings within the data. By doing so, we aim to help businesses understand their customer base more deeply and develop targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Activities

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** 
    - Loaded the dataset.
    - Checked for null values.
    - Ensured data types were appropriate for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis.
    - Understood the distribution and relationships between different variables.

3. **Visualization:** 
    - Created various plots including distribution plots, KDE plots, boxplots, and scatter plots to visualize the data and the results of the clustering.

4. **Clustering:** 
    - Applied K-Means clustering algorithm to segment the customers based on their annual income, spending score, and other relevant attributes.

5. **Cluster Analysis:** 
    - Analyzed and interpreted the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into customer behavior.
